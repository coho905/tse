# Common (pagedir)

## This is implemented in pagedir.c, and defined in pagedir.h

## Implementation Differences: There is no difference between the implementation.md and this specific implementation, as both functions expected are provided.

## Assumptions: No assumptions made, however the program will not work if the pageDirectory is no pre-existing (handles this case just fine - though you might be disapointed).

## Use, run _make common.a_ to produce the library and _make clean_ to remove that and all the .o files. You can just say _#include "pagedir.h"_ to use the code defined in it after you created the library.
