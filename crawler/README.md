# Crawler

## This crawler is implemented in crawler.c

## There are no assumptions that went into making this, as it works with any cases given. 

## Implementation Difference: None. There are no differences between this and the implementation.md. It has all the same functions and modules as to be expected. Everything works as it should.

## Use. Firstly run _make crawler_. This will create the binary required. Then you can run _make test_ to run the autogenerated unit test (will take a long time). You can also use ./crawler internalURL existingPageDirecrty nonZeroDepth   The first two should be valid strings and the third should be a non-negative integer.
