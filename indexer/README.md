# Indexer

## This indexer is implemented in indexer.c

## There is a testing function available in indextest.c. It reads in the input from a file and then builds an index then prints it out to another given file.

## There are no assumptions that went into making this for indexer, as it works with any cases given. Although it will help if you use correct input types to get the correct values (i.e. using crawler directories in indexer). The index tester may assume that the content of the index file follows the format specified below; thus your code (to recreate an index structure by reading a file) need not have extensive error checking.

## Implementation Difference: None. There are no differences between this and the implementation.md. It has all the same functions and modules as to be expected. Everything works as it should.

## Use. Firstly run _make all_. This will create the binaries required. Then you can run _make test_ to run the autogenerated unit test (will take a long time). You can also use ./indexer pageDirectory desiredIndexFile. Or, use ./indextest oldIndexFilename newIndexFilename.
